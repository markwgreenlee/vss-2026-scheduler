# 📱 VSS 2026 Schedule Organizer — Installation & Usage Guide

## Quickstart for Conference Attendees

**No installation required.** Open the app in any phone browser by scanning this QR code:

![VSS 2026 Scheduler Web QR Code](vss-web-qr.png)

Or go directly to: **https://markwgreenlee.github.io/vss-2026-scheduler**

Works on any iPhone or Android. No app, no account, no setup.

> **Tip: load the app before you arrive at the venue.** Open the link at home or on cellular so the app is cached on your phone. It will then work even on slow or unreliable conference WiFi.

## Exporting to Calendar

### Exporting to Google Calendar

> **Suppress Google Calendar Alarms:**
> Google Calendar automatically adds a default reminder (usually 30 minutes) to every new event. During a conference this will cause your phone to alert repeatedly throughout the day. Before or after exporting, turn off the default reminder in Google Calendar:
> - Open the Google Calendar app → tap the **☰ Menu** → **Settings** → **General** → **Notifications** → set **Default notifications** to **None**.
> - Alternatively, delete the reminder manually from each event after saving it.

1. Go to the **Schedule** tab and make sure sessions are selected
2. Tap **"Google Calendar"** — an overlay appears showing "Session 1 of N"
3. Google Calendar opens in your browser with the first session pre-filled — tap **Save**
4. Return to the app and tap **"Next →"** to open the next session
5. Repeat until all sessions are saved, then tap **"Done"**

### Exporting to Apple Calendar (iOS only)

1. Go to the **Schedule** tab and make sure sessions are selected
2. Tap **"Apple Calendar"** — events are added directly to your calendar
3. No alarms are set automatically

### What's in Each Calendar Event

- ⏰ **Time** — exact start and end time, anchored to Eastern Daylight Time (Florida)
- 📍 **Location** — room or venue name
- 📝 **Title** — full presentation title, including poster number where applicable
- 👥 **Authors** — all author names and affiliations
- 📋 **Abstract** — full presentation abstract

## Troubleshooting

### App won't load

- Make sure you have an internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- If on slow conference WiFi, switch to cellular data for the initial load, then switch back
- Try clearing your browser cache and reloading

### Can't find presentations

- Try shorter search terms (e.g., "motion" instead of "visual motion")
- Search by author last name only (e.g., "Smith")
- Make sure the Day and Session Type filters are set to "All"
- Refresh the page to verify all 1,191 presentations are loaded

### Calendar export not working

**Google Calendar:**
- Verify you have a Google account and are signed in
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure pop-ups or new tabs are not being blocked by your browser

**Apple Calendar:**
- Make sure you are using the iOS app, not the web version in a browser
- Close and reopen the app and try again

### Calendar events show wrong time

- Enable automatic timezone on your phone:
  - **iPhone:** Settings → General → Date & Time → "Set Automatically" ON
  - **Android:** Settings → System → Date & Time → "Automatic date/time" ON
- Close and reopen the Calendar app

## For Developers

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markwgreenlee/vss-2026-scheduler.git
cd vss-2026-scheduler
npm install
npx expo start
```

### Building the Web Version

```bash
npx expo export --platform web
```

Output goes to `dist/`. Deployed automatically to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

### Building a Standalone Native App

To distribute without requiring Expo Go:

```bash
eas build --platform android   # produces .apk / .aab — requires free Expo account
eas build --platform ios       # produces .ipa — requires Apple Developer account ($99/yr)
```

### Development Commands

```bash
npm start              # Start development server
npm run ios            # Run on iOS Simulator (Mac only)
npm run android        # Run on Android Emulator
npm run build-android  # Build Android APK via EAS
npm run build-ios      # Build iOS app via EAS
```
