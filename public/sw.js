// Offline strategy, tuned for a conference venue.
//
// The old worker was network-first for everything with no timeout. On packed
// conference WiFi a request does not fail — it hangs, and the worker waits on a
// socket that never closes while a perfectly good cached copy sits unused. The
// symptom is not an error but an app that appears frozen.
//
// What the build actually serves splits cleanly in two:
//
//   * Content-addressed files — the JS bundle, the icon fonts, images. Their
//     filename carries a hash, so the bytes behind a URL can never change.
//     These are almost all of the payload, and they are served cache-first:
//     instant, and immune to a bad network.
//
//   * Four mutable files, of which only index.html matters. It is tiny, and it
//     is how a new programme reaches a device, since the data is compiled into
//     the bundle and a data change produces a new bundle hash. Served
//     network-first but with a short timeout, so a hung socket costs a couple
//     of seconds rather than the session.
//
// When the timeout fires we serve the cached copy and let the request continue.
// If what eventually arrives differs from what we served, the page is told, so
// someone who loaded the app before the programme was frozen can be offered a
// reload rather than quietly reading a stale schedule.

// Replaced with the app version at deploy time so each release gets its own
// cache and the previous one is discarded on activation.
